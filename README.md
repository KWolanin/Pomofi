# Pomofi - Minimalistic Pomodoro App - Work in progress ‚öô

Pomofi is an upcoming Pomodoro app for Android (and possibly iOS) with a minimalist approach. It offers a limited set of options and customizations, focusing on simplicity to help users stay productive without distractions. This project is also my personal playground for learning Dart and Flutter.

## Existing Features üçè
- Start/stop timer controls
- Option to switch between work and relax modes
- Selectable themes that reload without restarting the app

## Planned Features üöÄ
- Custom color theme creation
- Font selection
- Monetization support (no ads or subscriptions‚Äîonly purchasable themes and fonts)
- Music control for work/relax modes (disabled by default), with possible integrations
- Google account login with settings synchronization
- ‚Ä¶and more!
